	Use:   "package-creation",
	Short: "This utility will generate a hexdump package for testing uv_server ",
	Long: `The "package-creation" utility is a powerful tool designed to generate hexdump packages 
    for testing uv_server. This tool allows developers and system administrators to create structured 
    binary test packages for debugging, performance benchmarking, and protocol verification.
    
    Usage:
    - Generate a hexdump package from an input file or string.
    - Customize the output format and structure to fit specific testing needs.
    - Integrate with automated test suites to validate server behavior under various conditions.
    
    Examples:
    1. Generate a hexdump package from a file:
       package-creation -input file.bin -output test_package.hex
    
    2. Create a test package from a string:
       package-creation -data "Hello, world!" -output test_package.hex
    
    3. Customize the output with additional options:
       package-creation -input file.bin -format compact -compress -output optimized_package.hex
    
    By leveraging this tool, developers can efficiently create test cases for uv_server, ensuring 
    robustness, reliability, and correctness in handling binary data streams.`,
